## Motivation/problem statement

I plan to study how the pay of public employees varies across different positions, institutions, states, and time. 
I aim to classify different job types, with a focus on public university staff, among public institutions in Washington and California. I am interested in the types of positions which are most highly paid, and the pay ranges across these positions. I would also like to explore how employee salaries in different institutions, within the same state and different states, compare across similar positions. Finally, I hope to understand the trends in salaries across time, and whether salaries have generally increased at a rate higher than inflation. I plan to adjust salaries to reflect the costs of living across different states. 

I believe this topic is interesting and relevant because many public employees' salaries are funded by taxpayers, and states have the obligation to make this information public. According to the [Washington State Fiscal Information site](http://fiscal.wa.gov/supporta.aspx), "state revenue and expenditure data [should] be made as open, transparent, and publicly accessible as is feasible with the goal of making government more accountable". I believe it will be interesting to identify any disparities and trends in pay between different types of positions and different institutions. It will also be useful to understand whether employee salary increases over time have kept up with the pace of inflation. I believe this study will  reflect on the fairness of employee salaries and shed light on inequity as reflected by pay disparities.



## Data used

- [Washington state employee salaries database](http://fiscal.wa.gov/Salaries.aspx). 
This dataset contains information on all Washington state employees, the agency they work for, their job titles, and salary information from 2014 to 2018. The dataset is publicly available information pursuant to [RCW 42.56.210](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.210). No license or terms of use were provided in accompaniment with this dataset. This dataset will be the main source of information to help answer my problem statement, because it contains the most locally relevant information. My main ethical concern in using this dataset is that it contains personally sensitive information including employee names and salaries, which may raise concerns about privacy. To mitigate this concern, according to the [dataset FAQ page](http://fiscal.wa.gov/SalaryDataFAQ.pdf), "employee names are withheld for victims of domestic violence and for employees whose jobs require confidentiality", and per RCW 42.56.210, "information, the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy or vital governmental interests, can be deleted from the specific records sought".

- [California state employee salary data](https://publicpay.ca.gov/Reports/RawExport.aspx).
These datasets contain names of all California state public employees, their employing agency, job title, and their salary information as well as value of benefits, from 2009 to 2018. This data is publicly available information pursuant to [California Government Code section 12463](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&sectionNum=12463). No license or terms of use were provided in accompaniment with this dataset. This dataset will inform my analysis on equity in salaries across different states. Similarly to the Washington state data, the ethical issues raised by this dataset mainly relate to privacy. 

- [Bureau of Economic Analysis prices and inflation data](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation). I plan to use the [GDP Price Index](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/gdp-price-index) data to convert all salary data to 2018 real US dollars in order to allow comparison of salary levels across time accounting for inflation, and in addition I hope to use the [Regional Price Parities by State and Metro Area](https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/regional-price-parities-state-and-metro-area) data to produce comparisons of salary levels between different states accounting to differences in costs of living. These datasets contain economic indices that relate to relative price levels in the US across time and states, which will advance my goals per the problem statement by allowing me to produce comparable financial estimates. I was unable to find any license or terms of use associated with this data.



## Unknowns and dependencies

My only concerns relate to time constraints due to work and other personal commitments, as well as my health during the flu season. Barring any unexpected events, I fully expect to be able to complete this project by the end of the quarter.
